# Software Development Proficiency

Each level of achievement builds on the previous level, from left to right.

| Proficiencies   | Below Expectations       | Meets Most Expectations        | Exceeds Expectations       |
| :---			  | :-- 					 | :-- 						      | :-- 					   |
| Version Control | Few commits are made, often addressing multiple concerns (not atomic). | Each commit addresses just one project concern (atomic). | Each commit message succinctly describes the purpose of the commit. |
| Issue Management | Few issues are made, with limited comments, labels and milestones. | Uses issues to organize the work, including labels and helpful comments. | Issues are linked to commits via the commit messages, and milestones are used to further organize the work. |
| Readability: Layout | Lacks consistent indentation/spacing rules. | Code has clear and consistent indenting and spacing. | An automatic code linter is configured and used successfully. |
| Readability: Logic  | Arbitrary and nondescriptive names are often used. | Modules/functions/variables are clearly named to reflect their functionality (self-documenting code). |  Uses consistent logic patterns to make the control flow clear; avoids poor syntactic constructs. |
| Project Structure     | The code consists of a few very large files containing disparate elements. | The code is comprised of separate, well-focused files, none of them too large. | The project as a whole is organized in a sensible file structure. |
| Code Modularity | The code is barely decomposed into modules/classes. | The code is properly modular and the modules/classes have clearly-specified roles and responsibilities. | The inter-module interactions and module interfaces are clearly specified. |
| Maintainability: Functional Decomposition | The project has frequent code duplication and functions without a clear, singular purpose. | Code duplication is usually avoided by use of functional decomposition. | Each function has a clear, singular purpose. |
| Maintainability: Testing | Limited or no automated testing. | Has adequate automated unit testing code for public functions. | Has exemplary unit tests as well as automated integration testing. |
| Maintainability: Resource Separation | Special constants and string literals are used directly in the program logic. | Special constants and string literals are named and are separated from the program logic. | Data resources are stored in a suitable data format and separated from the business logic of the project. |
| Code Documentation | The code contains limited or unhelpful comments. | The modules and functions are adequately documented in comments; inline comments are present where needed. | Module and function documenting comments are comprehensive and follow the documentation standard for the given language. |
| User Documentation | No user documentation. | Includes installation instructions and very basic user's guide. | Includes an extensive user's guide in an appropriately sharable form (e.g., webpage). |
