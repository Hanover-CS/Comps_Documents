Each level of achievement builds on the previous level, from left to right.

| Proficiencies (weight)   | Below Expectations       | Meets Most Expectations        | Exceeds Expectations       |
| :------------            | :----------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Version Control (10) | Few commits are made, often addressing multiple concerns (not atomic). | Each commit addresses just one project concern (atomic). | Each commit message succinctly describes the purpose of the commit. |
| Issue Management (10) | Few issues are made, with limited comments, labels and milestones. | Effectively uses issues to organize the work, including labels and helpful comments. | Issues are linked to commits via the commit messages, and milestones are used to further organize the work. |
| Readability: Layout (5) | Contains many long lines of code. | Lacks consistent indentation/spacing rules. | Code has clear and consistent indenting and spacing. |
| Readability: Logic (10) | Most names used are short and unhelpful. | The naming of code elements does reflect their purposes. | Modules/functions/variables are clearly named to reflect their functionality (self-documenting code). |
| Project Structure (5) | The code consists of a few very large files containing disparate elements. | The code is comprised of separate, well-focused files, none of them too large. | The project as a whole is organized in a sensible file structure. |
| Code Modularity (15) | The code is barely decomposed into modules/classes. | The code is properly modular and the modules/classes have clearly-specified roles and responsibilities. | The inter-module interactions and module interfaces are clearly specified in the documentation/comments. |
| Maintainability: Functional Decomposition (15) | The project has frequent code duplication and functions without a clear, singular purpose. | Code duplication is usually avoided by use of functional decomposition. | Each function has a clear, singular purpose. Long functions are avoided. |
| Maintainability: Testing (10) | No visible automated tests. | Automated tests are present but occasionally insufficient. | Has adequate automated unit testing code for public functions. |
| Maintainability: Resource Separation (5) | Special constants and string literals are used directly in the program logic. | Special constants and string literals are named and are separated from the program logic. | Data resources are stored in a suitable data format and separated from the business logic of the project. |
| Code Documentation (10) | The code contains limited or unhelpful comments. | The modules and functions are adequately documented in comments; inline comments are present where needed. | Module and function documenting comments are comprehensive and follow the documentation standard for the given language. |
| User Documentation (5) | No user documentation. | Includes installation instructions and very basic user's guide. | Includes an extensive user's guide in an appropriately sharable form (e.g., webpage). |
