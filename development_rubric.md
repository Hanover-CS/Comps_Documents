| Proficiencies (weight)   | Below Expectations       | Meets Expectations        |
| :------------   | :----------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Testing (10) | Insufficient automated tests. | Automated unit testing code is adequate for the given project. |
| Naming (10) | Most names used are short and/or unhelpful. | Modules/functions/variables are clearly named to reflect their functionality (self-documenting code). |
| Data Modelling (10) | Program data is stored in individual variables without using appropriate data structures to organize it. | Custom classes and common data structures such as arrays and dictionaries are appropriately used to organize the program data. |
| Functional Decomposition (10) | The project has few functions or functions lack a clear, singular purpose. | Functions have a clear, singular purpose. Long functions are avoided. |
| Code Duplication (10) | The project has frequent instances of code duplication | Code duplication is generally avoided. |
| Code Modularity (10) | The code is barely decomposed into modules/classes. | The code is for the most part decomposed into suitable modules/classes with well-defined responsibilities. |
| Version Control (10) | Few commits are made, often addressing multiple concerns (not atomic). | Frequents commits are made, each addressing just one project concern (atomic). |
| Issue Management (5) | Issues are not used effectively. | Issues are used effectively to organize the work. |
| Formatting (5) | Contains many long lines of code or blocks of commented-out code which should have been deleted. | Code has consistent and appropriate indenting and spacing that reflects the logical structure of the code. |
| Project Structure (5) | The code consists of a few very large files containing disparate elements. | The code is comprised of separate, well-focused files, none of them too large. |
| Resource Separation (5) | Literal values are frequently used directly in the program. | Literal values are typically stored in constant variables instead of being used directly. |
| Inline Comments (5) | Code contains unhelpful inline comments, or complex code lacks explanatory inline comments. | Explanatory inline comments are used when and only when needed to clarify complex code segments. |
| Code Documentation (5) | Modules and functions are in general not documented. | Most modules and functions are adequately documented. |
